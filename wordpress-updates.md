# WordPress Update Service
Product-Website: https://25space.com/wordpress/

## When I will receive the update?
We start rolling out new updates on the 20th of every month. Between the 20th and the last day of the month the updates are installed on the customer systems. Therefore, it can happen that a web page briefly indicates that new updates are available.
Should an update close a serious security gap or be a pure security update, it will be distributed to the customer systems much faster.

## Can I used it for websites which are not by 25Space hosted?
Yes, just create the new app in the Cloud Management Suite. Enter the URL and create the system-user.

## Admin-System User
The user displayed in the application must be created on the page with administrative rights. With this user the updates on your website are installed or executed.

## About Plugin Updates
You can activate individually for each page whether updates should also be updated.
