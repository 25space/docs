## What do I need for free-usage?
Almost a file, the receiver email and if needed a password to protect the data.

## Why I should create a free account?
You get an overview of the shared content and the status. You also have access to other cloud services from 25Space.com.

## What appens when the time is over?
After the available time of a share has expired, the data will be deleted. For shares without an account, the other details and data are also deleted. These cannot be restored either.
