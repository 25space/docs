# General Privacy

## Overview
Data protection and privacy is one of the most important issues for us. We develop every service and every product on the basis of data protection. Therefore we constantly check all our systems and partners for this topic. Of course, this also includes compliance with the necessary laws such as the GDPR / DSGVO. We have, for example, already fully supported and complied with these requirements almost a year before the legal introduction.
In the following you will find further information and documents on this topic. If something is unclear, please feel free to contact us.

## GDPR / DSGVO 
[Visit our own GDPR website >](https://legal.25space.com/gdpr.php)

### How do I conclude an ADV under the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?
If you process personal data in the context of our services, you and we are obliged, pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, to conclude an order processing agreement. Please check whether you process personal data with the services provided by us. If this is the case, please conclude this agreement with us.

### Topic “whois database”.
As a domain owner, your data is stored in the registry for public registration. We are legally obligated to this action. However, the legal questions regarding the registration of the “ICANN” are not yet finally clarified.[ See this article at t3n](https://t3n.de/news/whois-ende-domain-auskunft-1022423/)

### Where is the data?
For safety reasons, we can not provide detailed information about our computer centers. Basically, the server location Germany is active by default. We also offer more (worldwide) IT locations (different by product), but without your intervention, these will be processed and stored in Germany. The data centers we use are in Berlin and Frankfurt. These data centers are highly modern and are monitored and managed 24/7, protected against unauthorized access by various access controls and other technical measures. These systems are designed to be redundant and offer a high degree of reliability in the event of faults or other problems.

### DSGVO ready!
Our products are fundamentally the same as our new privacy policy. Hereby we point out that in order to comply with all guidelines from your side, if necessary, an ADV and further measures must be taken!
If you have further questions, you are welcome to contact our customer service at any time. We also have an additional website about the DSGVO/GDPR.
