## WebApps Access - Via Web Manager



## WebApps Application Default Access
If you order a pre-installed application (like WordPress) for WebApps, access is automatically created here. This is different from accessing the WebApp (web space) itself.

### Installations after 2020
You will receive a individual crypt password for the installation.

### Installations until end of 2019
Until 2019 all pre-installations have the login passowrd like the following:
User: admin
Password: password123!
Please change it afterwards!


## MySQL External Access
Update August 2020
You can only access our database services our from own hosting services. This includes our virtual servers and also the WebApp platform. The URL and port information you will find in the Cloud Management Suite > Applications.

### Update from 29.11.2018
On 8th December 2018 we will stop the external access for all our MySQL Database Server and Applications. On this date you will only reach your database from your server, WebApp or mdct Cloud Application. Please make sure that you are connected to our MySQL Server via “localhost” or the known URL on an application, which is hosted on a mdct Cloud Product.
Please note: Our vServers are not allowed to connect to our database system.
We proceed this step as a part against cyber security.
