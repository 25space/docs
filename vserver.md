## Monthly server updates
We offer monthly patch installation of your Linux environment. Simply activate this in your server settings after placing your order.
Go to your server in the Cloud Management Suite and activate the update service there via a support ticket. Alternatively, you can start the request directly below.
We will deal with you regarding access and you will then receive the latest patches installed on a monthly basis without you having 
to worry about it. We do not carry out release updates as a matter of principle.
