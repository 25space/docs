Plese note, that some statistics are not your local time. Also on our BI Analytic System we set the default Time-Zone “GMT” for single websites. You can watch the live-time on our BI time page: https://bi.25space.com/time.php

## DO-NOT-TRACK SETTINGS
We respect the privacy! If users have their browser set to “I do not want to be tracked” (Do-Not-Track enabled) then mdct Cloud Analytics will not track those visits. o-not-track is a technology and policy proposal designed to allow users to independently decide if their behavior is being tracked by websites, ad networks, and social networks. This function is permanently activated.
### Deactivation for visitors
You can let your visitors decide if you want to evaluate them. Therefore, you can use the following HTML code (eg privacy page) to give your visitors the opportunity to opt-out. This code appears within an iframe and contains a link that places a cookie in your visitor’s browser, disabling capture by Webanalytics.
