## Are there delays in the cronjob
No, we call up your page in the time periods you specify. However, there may be a slight delay, as many other pages are accessed by other users. However, these delays are in the range of a few seconds.

## How does it work?
We call your pages like a browser, but with the following restrictions:
- No extended objects are loaded (such as: flash, objects, images, etc)
- No JS is executed
- No cookies
- No meta-refreshs are followed
