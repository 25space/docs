### Billing
You will receive your invoice on the 15th or 01. of the month as a PDF file by e-mail. (Regardless of the payment method).

### PSD2 - Payment Security EU
The PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) is an EU directive regulating payment services and payment service providers.
PSD2 explained simply: Starting from 14.09.2019 (14th September 2019) a two-stage verification helps the customer with the safe payment in the Internet. A single password will no longer suffice in the future. Recently, you have required two or more factors from different categories for payment or other “activities with a risk of fraud”. For example, a combination of password and fingerprint is conceivable, or a PIN that is linked to the smartphone. But PIN and TAN are also a valid combination. Your bank decides on the necessity and type of the second authentication.
What changes for me?
Basically, everything stays the same for you.In the payment process on our website or in the app it may happen from 14.09.2019 that a further step is added in which the bank secures your identity. Verification is simply integrated into the payment process.
- Basically, the most task are the same.
- During the payment process it may happen that the payment provider (Bank, PayPal,…) requires further authentication.
- This is not necessary for payment on account, as no payment information is shared here (like pay later).

## Security

### Multifactor Authentication / 2-Factor Authentication
For even greater account security, we recommend that account holders use two-factor authentication to log in to their account. This extra layer of security for your account ensures that you are the only person who has access to your account. Also known as “MFA, Multi Factor Authentication or 2FA.
**What is it about?**
The two factor authentication provides increased security for your account. After login a security pin is sent to your email address. Thus, additional access to the e-mail mailbox is necessary. This PIN is necessary in addition to the password for the login.
**How to I activate?**
Log into the Cloud Management Suite and select “Settings > Account”. Here you find a drop down menue to activate more security for your account.

### Phishing
So-called “phishing” e-mails are circulating again and again. With phishing, third parties try to obtain confidential access data such as passwords and impersonate mdct Group or 25Space.com, for example. Such e-mails do not come from us! You can ignore these phishing e-mails and delete them directly.
Pay attention to the actual sender of the email, often this is an external or foreign email address. In addition, you can recognize such websites via the URL in your browser (https://….). The domain known to you must be displayed here.
Important: If you have already entered your data on the linked website, please change your password immediately. If you can no longer access your account with your previous password, please contact us immediately so that we can reconcile the data and send you the link for a new password.
We additionally recommend the use of a 2 factor authentication, which can be activated for each account.
